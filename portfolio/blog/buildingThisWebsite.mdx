## Behind its release process

When building this website, I decided to split its development up into 3 distinct V0 releases phases on its way to V1. These phases are:

- v0.1.0 which is the base barebones of the website where the website is deployed with a basic home page, giving me something to show and host
- v0.2.0 which is a more fleshed out version of the website and analytics for the website has been wired 
- v0.3.0 closing in on the final state of the website with regards to content and a headless CMS has been wired in and exposed out as well
- v0.3.1 Final clean up of the content in the website, analytics dashboards as well as CMS config
- v1.0.0 V1 released

### Why Did I choose to break it up like this?

At the end of the day, this is a website to showcase my skills and promote myself, but also for others to use and steal bits and bobs from it if they wish. I beleive breaking it up
into those 3 distinct pre-releases, will allow people to more easily find sections of my website that they want to replicate.
