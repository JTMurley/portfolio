title: Integrating PostHog into Docusaurus
description: Step-by-step guide to implement PostHog analytics in a Docusaurus site for user behavior tracking and insights
---

## Introduction

[PostHog](https://posthog.com) is an open-source product analytics platform that helps track user interactions with applications. This guide covers integrating PostHog into a Docusaurus site to:

- Track page views and user journeys
- Capture custom events and feature usage
- Analyze user behavior through session recordings
- Implement A/B testing and feature flags

PostHog is recommended for its:
- Open-source nature with self-hosting capability
- Generous free tier for small projects
- Embedded iframe support for sharing insights

## Prerequisites

- Docusaurus v2.0+ project
- [PostHog account](https://app.posthog.com/signup)
- Basic React knowledge

## Installation

1. Install the PostHog Docusaurus plugin:

```bash npm2yarn
yarn add posthog-docusaurus
```

2. Initialize PostHog in your Docusaurus configuration (`docusaurus.config.js`):

```javascript docusaurus.config.js
plugins: [
    [
      "posthog-docusaurus",
      {
        apiKey: process.env.POSTHOG_API_KEY,
        appUrl: "https://us.i.posthog.com", // Optional, defaults to "https://us.i.posthog.com"
        enableInDevelopment: false, // Set to true to enable in development
      },
    ],
  ],
```

**Important**: Never commit API keys to your repository. Use environment variables instead.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set the `POSTHOG_API_KEY` as an environment variable:

1. Create `.env` file in project root:
```ini
POSTHOG_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

2. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`:
```gitignore
# .gitignore
.env
```

### CI/CD Setup (GitHub Actions Example)

1. Add the secret in your repository settings (Settings → Secrets → Actions)
2. Reference in workflow file:

```yaml .github/workflows/deploy.yml
steps:
  - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
    env:
      POSTHOG_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.POSTHOG_API_KEY }}
    # ... rest of deployment steps
```

## Troubleshooting

### Events not appearing
1. Verify network requests in browser dev tools
2. Confirm API key matches PostHog project
3. Ensure `enableInDevelopment` is true for local testing

### Session recordings missing
1. Check PostHog project settings
2. Verify no ad blockers are interfering
3. Confirm no CSP restrictions block PostHog domains

### Feature flags not working
1. Check flag activation in PostHog dashboard
2. Verify correct user/distinct ID propagation
